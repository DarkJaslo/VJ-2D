This is a 2D platform game. For all intents and purposes it is a clone of Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse, for the SEGA Master System. We made it as a [university project](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/VJ) using C++ and OpenGL.
