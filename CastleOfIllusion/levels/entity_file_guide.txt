To spawn an entity, use the following format. All positions are in tilemap coords unless otherwise specified

Chest:
chest <posX> <posY> <cake|coin> <big|small> 

Void:
void <upleft_corner_posX> <upleft_corner_posY> <sizeX> <sizeY>
*sizes are also in tiles

CameraPoint:
void <upleft_corner_posX> <upleft_corner_posY> <sizeX> <sizeY> <respawnX> <respawnY> <scrollY>
*sizes are also in tiles

Platform:
platform <upleft_corner_posX> <upleft_corner_posY>

Barrel:
barrel <pos_x> <pos_y>

Horse:
horse <pos_x> <pos_y>

Probably chests are being put "between" tiles because the position (not the corner position) is given. 
Correct this later if needed
